            <p class="faqQuestion">When can I expect to hear back?</p>
            <p class="faqAnswer">Decisions will be sent out in 2 rounds, tentatively scheduled for MONTH XX and XX.</p>

            <p class="faqQuestion">Can I compete with a different team than the one I applied with?</p>
            <p class="faqAnswer">Your team number is just for your application so we can review your team together. It is not deciding and not needed during the event. You have until the event to choose a team and must submit to Devpost with the final team.</p>

            <p class="faqQuestion">I don’t have a team. What can I do?</p>
            <p class="faqAnswer">All teams competing must have 3 or 4 members, but you do not need a full team in order to apply. We have a #team-formation channel on Slack as well as a team formation event scheduled before hacking starts at the event.</p>

            <p class="faqQuestion">Are decisions unanimous for a team?</p>
            <p class="faqAnswer">Due to the large number of applicants and limited number of spots for {{ event_name }}, decisions may not be unanimous. Each member should expect an email regarding their individual decisions.</p>

            <p class="faqQuestion">Who can I contact if I’ll be late?</p>
            <p class="faqAnswer">Please send an email to <a href="mailto:{{ contact_email }}" class="hoverLink">{{ contact_email }}</a> with your name, email you used to apply, expected arrival time, and reason as to why you’re arriving late and we’ll save your spot for you.</p>

            <p class="faqQuestion">How does the waitlist work the day of?</p>
            <p class="faqAnswer">The rank on the waitlist is first-come first serve, meaning the sooner you arrive at the event on Saturday, the higher your placement on our waitlist. At 10AM, if we have any spots remaining, we will be letting waitlisted people in.</p>

            <p class="faqQuestion">Other questions?</p>
            <p class="faqAnswer">If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:{{ contact_email }}" class="hoverLink">{{ contact_email }}</a>.</p>
